Also let $\\mathbf{h}_t$ be the *decoder* RNN state after it consumes the $t$th target token (i.e., the $t$th token in the logical form).

        "## Beam Search\n",
        "\n",
        "We will now try to improve our model's predictions by decoding with beam search, rather than greedily. Beam search maintains a `beam_size`-length list of hypotheses at each step of decoding. A hypothesis is just a prefix of a full prediction, and is represented in the code below by a `Hyp` object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What beam search does, in (mostly) words\n",
        "Beam search starts with a hypothesis consisting just of the BOS token, and then proceeds for `output_max_len` steps. At each step $t$, beam search considers adding every possible next-word to the hypotheses/prefixes from step $t-1$ (for a total of `beam_size`*V hypotheses). It then takes the highest scoring `beam_size` of these candidate hypotheses to be the hypotheses at step $t$. The score of a hypothesis of length $t$ is:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mathrm{score}(w_1, \\ldots, w_t) = \\sum_{i=1}^t \\log p(w_i|w_1, \\ldots, w_{i-1}, x)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "where $x$ is the source question. The log probabilities above are just the standard ones output by your RNN decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "A hypothesis is finished when it ends with an EOS token.\n",
        "\n",
        "With beam search, you should get an improvement of at least 1 BLEU over greedy search, and should reach above 21 BLEU without attention and above 38 BLEU with attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1) A good general strategy when doing complex code like this is to carefully annotate each line with a comment saying what each dimension represents.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) You should only need one call to topk per step. You do not need to have a topk just over vocabulary first, you can directly go from vocab_size*beam_size to beam_size items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Be sure you are correctly keeping track of which beam item a candidate is selected from and updating the beam states, such as LSTM hidden state, accordingly. A single state from the previous time step may need to be used for multiple new beam items or not at all. This includes all state associated with a beam, including all past tokens output by the beam and any extra tensors such as ones remembering when a beam is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Once an EOS token has been generated, save the hypothesis and take it out of the beam for the next timestep.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Implementation Task \\# 3**\n",
        "Fill in the missing code in the `predict_beam` function below. You are not implementing batched beam_search so you only need to consider one sentence at a time."

One popular technique people used in machine translation is called back translation(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07512). Train another model from English to Gernman and consturct more data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Word embeddings**: You can try initializing the input word embeddings with [Glove vectors](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). You should try both finetuning these embeddings or keeping them fixed.\n",
        "* **Regularization**: You can also try some of the regularization techniques we tried in the language modeling assignment, however these may or may not help.\n",
        "* **Tokenization**: Exploring with how tokenization is done or how big vocabulary size is can also be helpful. We used unigram language model subword tokenization and use a vocabulary of size 8000. You can consider using BPE (a very popular tokenization technique) or using characters or even some others.\n",
